## TYPES IN TYPESCRIPT

Certainly! Let's delve a bit into the theoretical aspects of the basic types in TypeScript:

1. **Boolean:**
   * Represents a binary choice or a logical value. It's commonly used in conditional statements and expressions.
2. **Number:**
   * Represents numeric values and supports both integers and floating-point numbers. TypeScript provides support for different number bases like decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and octal.
3. **String:**
   * Represents textual data. Strings in TypeScript can be enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. Additionally, TypeScript supports template strings, allowing the embedding of expressions within strings.
4. **Array:**
   * Represents a collection of values of the same type. Arrays in TypeScript can be declared using square brackets with the type of the elements.
5. **Tuple:**
   * Represents an ordered collection of elements, each with a specific type. Tuples allow expressing an array where the type of a fixed number of elements is known.
6. **Enum:**
   * Provides a way to organize a collection of related numeric values. Enums in TypeScript make code more readable and self-explanatory.
7. **Any:**
   * Represents a type that can hold values of any type. It is often used when the type of a variable is not known or when interfacing with dynamic content.
8. **Void:**
   * Represents the absence of a type. It's commonly used as the return type for functions that don't return any value.
9. **Null and Undefined:**
   * Represent special types for null and undefined values, respectively. They are often used to indicate the absence of a value.
10. **Object:**
    * Represents any non-primitive type. It is a type that can hold any value except `null` and `undefined`.

Understanding these basic types is foundational to writing type-safe and maintainable TypeScript code. TypeScript's type system allows developers to catch potential errors during development and provides better tooling support for code editors and IDEs. This helps in enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of software written in TypeScript.


# VARIABLES IN TYPESCRIPT


Certainly! Let's explore the theoretical aspects of variables in TypeScript:

### 1. **Variable Declaration:**

* Variables in TypeScript are declared using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords.
* `let` is used for variables that can be reassigned, `const` for constants, and `var` is an older way of declaring variables.

2. **Type Annotations:**

* TypeScript allows developers to specify the type of a variable explicitly using type annotations.
* This helps in enforcing type constraints and catching potential type-related errors during development.

### 3. **Type Inference:**

* TypeScript features type inference, which means the compiler can automatically determine the type of a variable based on its initialization.
* This helps reduce the need for explicit type annotations in many cases.

### 4. **Union Types:**

* Variables can be of multiple types using union types. This allows a variable to hold values of more than one specific type.

### 5. **Any Type:**

* The `any` type is a special type that represents a dynamic or unknown type.
* It can be used when the variable's type is not known during development or when interacting with dynamic content.

### 6. **Void Type:**

* The `void` type is used as the return type for functions that do not return any value.
* It indicates that the function is executed for its side effects rather than producing a value.


Understanding these theoretical concepts about variables in TypeScript is crucial for writing robust and type-safe code. It allows developers to define the shape and constraints of their data, leading to better code quality and maintainability.
