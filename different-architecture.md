<!-- Create a file named 'different-architecture.md' and elucidate the distinctions among various architectural types, outlining their unique characteristics and differences from one another. -->

# Different Architectural Types

# 1.Monolithic Architecture:
   Monolithic architecture is a unified model where all components are tightly coupled into a single executable codebase, making it simple to develop but challenging to scale and maintain.

# 2. *Microservices Architecture:
   Microservices divide an application into small, independent services, promoting flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance through loosely coupled components.

# 3. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):
   SOA structures an application as a collection of services that communicate with each other, promoting reusability and interoperability across various business functions.

# 4. Client-Server Architecture:
   In client-server architecture, clients request services or resources from servers, facilitating centralized control and efficient resource management.

# 5. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture:
   P2P architecture enables nodes to communicate directly with each other, distributing both processing and data storage responsibilities across the network.

# 6. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):
   EDA is centered around the production, detection, and reaction to events, allowing for decoupled and asynchronous communication between components.

# 7. Layered Architecture:
   Layered architecture organizes components into horizontal layers, each responsible for a specific set of functionality, promoting modularity and maintainability.

# 8. Space-Based Architecture:
   Space-based architecture breaks down an application into processing units called spaces, allowing for parallel and distributed computing for improved performance.

# 9. Serverless Architecture:
   Serverless architecture abstracts server management, enabling developers to focus solely on code, automatically handling infrastructure scaling and maintenance.

# 10. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):
    EDA structures an application around the production, detection, and handling of events, fostering loose coupling and responsiveness.
